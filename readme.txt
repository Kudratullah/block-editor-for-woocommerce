Enable Block Editor (Gutenberg) For WooCommerce.

== Description ==

### WooCommerce + Gutenberg (The Block Editor) = awesome 🤩

Now you can experiment with the visual block editor feature for editing WooCommerce Product description built within WordPress. This plugin will enable you to use all blocks provided by Gutenberg as-well-as all other awesome blocks released by many plugin authors.

Many people use visual editor for editing the WooCommerce Product. I was just experimenting with the Block Editor (Gutenberg), which now shipped with WordPress as the default editor. I enjoy using Block Editor and always wanted to use it with WooCommerce.
